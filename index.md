# Did You Say SparX?

SparX is a [small team](/who-we-are) executing on the firm belief that
the future of eCommerce is driven by technical innovation and
operational excellence.

We operate in [skunk works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works)
mode within Staples, with an exceptional degree of autonomy, tasked to
design and build the products that will shape Staples' future.

We do not wait for technical innovation to bake before we start
leveraging it. Quite the contrary, we recognize the trend early and
push in driving the technology forward. We have been leveraging **Big
Data, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Real-time Distributed
Systems, and Clojure** as early as 2010. We draw all this together to
build [actual products](/what-we-do), running in production, and which
directly impact Staples' bottom line.

The great thing is that Staples is the world's **3rd largest eCommerce
player**, so no problem is trivial and the sky is the limit. If you
want a worthy challenge: scale, a firehose of data, the chance to
target and impact **50 million users**... we got it!

# Join the Team

Sounds like the kind of environment in which you would make a
difference? We are always **seeking talented and passionate people**
with a flair for machine learning, engineering, design, products,
operations, and more. Bonus points if you can bridge 2 or more of
these together. We love people with strong fundamentals and who can
dive deep.

We're a small team, so you will have an opportunity for a high-impact
role, targeting over 50 million users.

But our best perk is our colleagues: a diverse and extremely talented
team of stunning engineers, data-scientists and eCommerce experts.
